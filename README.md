# CompressPDFSlides
I made this to compress my lecturers' Powerpoint slides which are always huge. I needed smaller files so OneNote can import them without crashing from exhausting system RAM.

Dependancies:
GPL Ghostscript (https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)
or "Choco install Ghostscript" if you're using Chocolatey

Intended to be run from C:\TEMP, simply drop the pdf file onto the cmd file.
Two variations included with different commands for different situations.
